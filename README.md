# DeepQ-Learning-Sample-Projects
Some projects trained using OpenAI gym environments using DeepQ learning

## Lets Break Suma! vs Deep Q
An on going project whereby a Deep Q learning algorithm attempts to solve a game environment created by Suma Amriez. Link to created game can be found here: https://github.com/Amreiz/LetsBreakSuma. How to launch and test the AI coming soon!

## Fully connected version
Video demos on the AI playing the Atari breakout game from OpenAI gym environment.

This repository contains demo videos of environments trained using DeepQ learning which uses policy and Target networks to learn to solve environments based solely on image data, actions and rewards
