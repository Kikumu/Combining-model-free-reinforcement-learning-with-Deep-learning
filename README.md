# DeepQ-Learning-Sample-Projects.
Some projects trained using OpenAI gym environments using DeepQ learning. This repository contains demo videos and sample code of environments trained using DeepQ learning which uses policy and Target networks to learn to solve environments based solely on image data, actions and rewards.

## LetsBreakSuma vs Deep Q.
An on going project whereby a Deep Q learning algorithm attempts to solve a game environment created by Suma Amreiz. Link to created game can be found here: https://github.com/Amreiz/LetsBreakSuma. How to launch and test the AI coming soon!

### Project stats:
1) Image pre-processing (Complete)
2) Action space formatting (Complete)
3) Action space mapping(Complete)
4) Fully connected network skeleton(Complete)
5) Reward state and mapping(Complete)
6) Environment training space design algorithm(Complete)
7) Train AI(100 games)(Complete!)
8) Video Demo(Complete!)

NEEDS REVIEWING
Short Demonstation video of the AI model in action can be found here: https://youtu.be/TJhAUeAj1zg

#### Current bug/error.
1) **afew action space bugs encountered hindering models optimal performance. *fixed***
2) **Environment end and start not matching properly. Currently working on it!**
